My Project made in order to learn Website Animation basics using GSAP from Js.
GSAP Basics – Learning Through Action
I recently completed a project to understand the fundamentals of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).
No frameworks. No shortcuts. Just HTML, CSS, and GSAP, line by line.
<br>
The goal was clear:
→ Understand how animations work
→ Learn how timelines, delays affect the user experience
<br>
What I focused on:
Structuring a layout manually (HTML/CSS)
Triggering element animations using GSAP
Managing flow and timing with timelines
Keeping the site non-responsive (on purpose) to stay focused on animation logic
<br>
Every part of this was built with intention.
I didn’t just copy tutorials,I broke things, fixed them, and tested until I understood the “why” behind each line.
This isn’t a polished final product.
It’s a learning exercise, and I’m documenting the process as I go.

If you’ve worked with GSAP before or just enjoy clean UI/UX, I’d genuinely appreciate your feedback.
<br>
I’m currently learning JavaScript and responsive design, and I’ll be applying both in upcoming projects.<br>
